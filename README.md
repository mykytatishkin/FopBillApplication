First of all, short story tell. In my IT Academy, I took a task to make an desctop application in WPF. After that a went to my close friends and parents and asked 
them for idea. One of them gave me an idea to make application for FOP to generate bills using DataBase, i think, it will be a SQL Server.
<br> So, it this repository, you can check my work and result of my work!

```TSQL
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[MyCompany]
(
	[Id] INT NOT NULL, 
    [Name] NCHAR(255) NOT NULL, 
    [Code] NCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
    [Address] NCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    CONSTRAINT PK_MyCompany_Id primary key (Id)
);
